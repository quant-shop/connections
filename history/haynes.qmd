## Exhibiting the Historical Significance of Euphemia Lofton Haynes

"The Haynes Project: Exhibiting the Historical Significance of the Philosophical Views of American Mathematicians" is a three-year funded initiative creating a comprehensive digital repository of **Dr. Euphemia Lofton Haynes (1890-1980)** — the first African American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics (Catholic University, 1943). Led by John Stigall (Director, Howard University) and co-director Nathan Alexander (Howard University), this flagship project anchors The Connections Project.

### Core Components

**Network Analysis Focus**

- Haynes was central node connecting HBCU faculty, DC educators, and civil rights mathematicians

- Institutional ties (Smith College, Chicago, Catholic U, Miner Teachers College)

- Professional relationships during school desegregation era

**Philosophical Significance**

The project recovers Haynes' philosophical views on mathematics education, school integration, and Black intellectual networks—lost contributions now digitized for public access and scholarly analysis.
