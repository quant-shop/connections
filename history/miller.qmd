## The First Black Mathematics Graduate Student

**Kelly Miller (1863-1939)** was the first African American graduate student in mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. Later, as dean of Howard University (1903-1935) and founder of the Negro Sanhedrin (1924), Miller served as a crucial network connector between W.E.B. Du Bois and other Black intellectual leaders.

### Key Contributions

**Mathematics Scholarship**:

- Studied under mathematician Simon Newcomb at Johns Hopkins

- First Black student to complete graduate-level mathematics coursework in the U.S.

- Applied mathematical reasoning to social analysis in early sociological work

**Negro Sanhedrin (1924)**:

- Convened 200+ Black leaders in Chicago to coordinate civil rights strategy

- Positioned between Du Bois' radicalism (NAACP) and Garvey's nationalism

- Created formal network structure for Black leadership coordination

### Network Role: Du Bois Connector

Miller's brokerage position linked:

- **W.E.B. Du Bois** (Harvard PhD, *The Souls of Black Folk*, NAACP)

- **Booker T. Washington** (Tuskegee, economic self-help)

- **Carter G. Woodson** (Association for the Study of Negro Life)

- **Howard University faculty** and HBCU presidents

**Key documented ties**:

- Published Du Bois' early sociological work in *Howard University Record*

- Mediated between Niagara Movement and Tuskegee Machine

- Corresponded with mathematicians and statisticians analyzing racial data

### Archival Sources for Network Reconstruction

- **Library of Congress**: Miller Papers (correspondence with Du Bois, Washington)

- **Howard University Archives**: Dean records, Sanhedrin proceedings

- **Moorland-Spingarn Research Center**: Negro Sanhedrin delegate lists

- **Johns Hopkins University**: Early graduate student records
