title: "The Networks"
---

This section introduces the network perspectives that guide The Connections Project.

Here you can briefly describe:
- What kinds of ties you model (e.g., correspondence, institutional movement, co-authorship).
- How archival records are translated into network data.
- How the Haynes and Miller projects fit into the broader set of networks.
